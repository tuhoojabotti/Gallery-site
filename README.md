## Project updates
 * CRUD added for photos
   * Started learning Angular UI router
   * FB SDK async load
 * The documentation contains an updated section (4.2.) on the log in flow
 * Backend code refactored, follows MV*-pattern (no views in REST)
   * Heavy use of dependency injection
 * Frontend AngularJS started, right now you can only verify log in, everything is still static
